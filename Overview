-------Video loop vulnerability details-----------
**************************************************

Discovery: 
The vulnerability was disclosed in May 2019 by researchers 
at the cybersecurity firm ESET.

Exploitation: 
The issue is part of a larger problem with unencrypted video
stream transmission. An attacker who performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack
can intercept the unencrypted video stream. By inserting a custom, modified 
video stream into the connection, the attacker can create a video loop 
to hide their activity from the user.

Cause: 
The DCS-2132L transmits its video feed unencrypted over a TCP tunnel. 
An attacker on the same local network can intercept this unencrypted communication 
to manipulate the stream.
